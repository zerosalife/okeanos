* Okeanos
Okeanos is a work-in-progress prototype.

* Design Notes
** Theme
You gather fish into a school that gets eaten by a bigger fish at the
end of each level.  the fish you've gathered become your ammo stock
for launching pachinko balls at the next level.

Fish

Trail of bubbles to indicate PC fish

Big whale shark comes from the side and eats you to transport to the
next board.

Big turtle, you ride its shell, could function like a water current.

Seaweed forests.

Coral reef with eels that come out and grab you.  How to make eels
interesting?  Go to one side a long distance, potentially go to the
other side the same distance, go to both sides a shorter distance.
Could do any of those three moves, unpredictable.

Electric eels

flounders

sting rays, could fly on sting rays.

Sharks are enemies

Tuna are bigger fish

squid

pelican

lobsters

puffer fish

Whirlpool

jelly fish

seals

otters

Clams

When you die, a lot of other fish come in from off-screen and eat the
PC, causing it to dissolve and become bones.

*** Terrain
water currents that transport you quickly, maybe laterally?
** Power ups

*** Shield
Grants 1 free hit.  If colliding with an enemy would normally kill
you, kill the enemy, grant the player experience.

Could prototype by simply granting 1 free level.

May be able to implement by swapping out component handling the player
colliding with enemies for a shield component.  Both of these
components would have methods that receive HandleCollision messages.
See:
file://localhost/Applications/Unity/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.SendMessage.html

*** Weapon
Grants 1 free level.

* First Prototype
To finish up
- [X] Test level up system - First pass
- [X] Separate Scene for Big Baddie fight.
- [X] Implement Big Baddie
  - (requires player to be level 3 to kill, starts at enemyLevel 1,
    instead of being destroyed gains levels upon hits, if enemyLevel 3
    and hit then dies.)
- [X] End state for game.
  - [X] Winning
    - It's just a basic gameover with a restart button
- [X] Opening
  - [X] Loop winning and Gameover back to opening via Start Over
    button.
- [-] Implement transition between scenes
  - GameManager?
  - [ ] Public facing getters and setters, keep variables private.
  - [X] Saving and loading state.

    - [[http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/live-training-archive/persistence-data-saving-loading]]
- [X] Clean up git.
- [X] Refactor code to use GameManager.
- [X] Display Score, Level, Exp
- [ ] Main theme upbeat, lively, boppy, sort of like zelda overworld
  theme.
  - [ ] Placeholder music in
- [ ] Opening music sort of like Chrono Trigger, sounds of waves
  (noise synths) fading into subdued theme.
  - Try Operator/Effects/Wind Machine
  - 2 tracks, one for crash and the other for whoosh of waves
    leaving.
- [-] SFX
  - [X] Hitting enemy.
  - [X] Hitting big enemy.
  - [ ] Enemy death.
  - [ ] Scene transition
  - [ ] Player Death.
- [X] license
- [X] add Ideas to .gitignore
- [-] Enemy death animation via a delegate function that controls
  movement in the Update method.
  - Spin the enemy while moving it off the bottom of the screen.
  - [X] Add a flash to white effect with a shader.
  - [X] Add shader to Boss, as well.
  - [X] Freeze the game for 20 ms so there's some weight to the
    collision.  Added bonus of letting the sound of the hit play out.
    - Write a Sleep function for the GameController that uses
      Time.timeScale to pause the game for a few ms.
  - Some sort of explosion?
  - [ ] Enemy death animation
- [X] More bass in the hit sounds.
- [X] Pop up with exp gained when enemies are killed
- [X] Dynamic PC placement by clicking.
- [-] Animate fish when it spawns so it's clear there was some
  interaction by the player.  (Don't think we need this now that the
  fish is visible on screen prior to spawning).
  - [X] Have the PC fade-in when spawned?
  - [ ] Ripple effect?
    [[http://entitycrisis.blogspot.com/2011/02/ripple-shader.html]]
- [X] Refactor Player class to be PC to reflect the fact that if this
  thang is Pachinko-like, the player will be able to spawn multiple
  PCs with clicks.
  - PCSpawner singleton?
- [ ] Refactor Big Enemy class to Boss.
  - [ ] Rename the prefabs and instances to reflect that they are
    BossBigBaddies.
- [ ] Refactor Destroying things to take advantage of the [[http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.Destroy.html][second
  parameter to Destroy]], destroy =t= seconds from now.
- [ ] Screenshake when the player dies
- [ ] Background
- [ ] Winning screen
- [ ] Change winning and gameover from scenes to a simple overlay
  script attached to the GameManager script that activates at the
  right time to show the score.
- [ ] Gameover
  - When you die, a lot of other fish come in from off-screen and
    eat the PC, causing it to dissolve and become bones.
  - [ ] use modal dialog to display score so the background scene
    remains on the screen.
  - May be as simple as adding UI stuff to a layer on top of
    everything else?
- [ ] scale buttons to screen size
- [ ] Dynamic enemy placement.
- [ ] Enemies contained in some empty parent gameobject to clean up
  the scenes.
- [-] Orbs floating around big baddie to communicate required
  hits-to-kill remaining. (i.e. if the baddie starts at enemyLevel 1
  and requires enemyLevel 3 to be killed, 3 orbs counting down with
  each hit.)
  - [[http://www.helixsoft.nl/articles/circle/sincos.htm]]
  - [[http://unitygems.com/basic-ai-space-shooter/]]
  - [X] For now do it the easy way, stup.
  - [-] HitCounterController Script attached to empty gameobject
    - [X] Has a HitCounter prefab
    - [ ] Receive message from BigBaddie to spawn number of HitCounters
      - =transform.RotateAround= will probably be helpful.
    - [X] Store a list of HitCounters in order (clockwise or
      counterclockwise).
    - [X] Receive message from BigBaddie to destroy HitCounter
    - [X] Add a real sprite.
- [ ] Add V0.2 tag / milestone
- [ ] Level02 hardcodes PC instance and position: Level02 assumes the
  player will be a typical PC fish that is already moving and is not
  an instance of the prefab PC.  That is to say, it's not the same
  instance as the spawned fish in the previous scene.  It's got the
  same stats though thanks to the GameController.
